# PyThink, therefore I Am

PyThink is a python Neural Network library with support for hardware acceleration. It the neural network library behind, and is being developed alongside [Babble](https://github.com/sl/babble).

## Why Not Just Use Pybrain?

Firstly, let's be clear that we love Pybrain. In fact, the first versions of babble used Pybrain! Unfortunately it doesn't have support for hardware acceleration. Because training complex networks on large datasets can take quite a while, we decided to build a solution that leverages parallel processing to vastly speed up training. We likely won't ever have the vast featureset of Pybrain, so if you need functionality which you can't find here, but aren't as worried about speed, we highly reccomend you go check it out [here](http://pybrain.org/).

## How Can I use PyThink?

Pythink is still in the very early stages of development. Once a stable, functional build is available, we'll make sure to let you know how to use it here!
